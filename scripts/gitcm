# Writing a typical commit message is like this
# git commit -m "added twitter authentication feature"
#
# with gitcm the above line can be written as
# gitcm added twitter authentication feature
# 
# Gotchas: If your message is something like this
# gitcm changed method name from twitterauth => twitter_authentication
# then the actual message passed to git commit would be only "twitterauth"
# becase of bash issue. If someone has a good fix for it then lemme know.
